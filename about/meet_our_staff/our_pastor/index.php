                                    I have served the greater Twin Cities during my vocational life. I served as a youth director in the Glen Lake area of
                                    Minnetonka for a couple years, as a youth director on the near northeast side of Minneapolis while attending seminary,
                                    my internship was in Marine On St. Croix north of Stillwater, my fist call was King of Kings in Woodbury, and in August
                                    1994, I was appointed by Division For Outreach to start a new ministry to serve north Farmington, eastern Lakeville.
                                    My wife, Sherri, works for Cargill, Inc. We were married in June 1986. Our son, Nate, is 21, a 4th year
                                    Communications student at The University of Minnesota, and a full time employee at the airport, serving Delta and
                                    Regional Services. Our daughter, Bre, is 19, and a first year student at Hamline, involved on campus on many levels,
                                    pursuing business, preparing to study abroad in York, England. Family and community are both important to
                                    me. My mother, my sister and her family, and my brother and his family, and most of Sherriâ€™s extended family, all live
                                    within the greater metro area. I enjoy the outdoors and staying active when possible. My goals for continuing
                                    education include pursuing a doctorate degree, and writing in the future.

                                    My vision for Lord of Life includes, first, staying faithful and honoring the amazing people of God and the mission and
                                    grace, God has brought together at this time, through this ministry. I believe God is forever leading us forward,
                                    making God first in many new ways, inviting us to always trust God is leading us in how we will next be asked to
                                    further develop our facility and staff. God continues to move us, and to move through us, to grow towards possible

                                    blessing us to make God first, through local and global ministry and mission events.
