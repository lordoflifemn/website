                                    Our church is not a building; it is group of regular people that have come together. United we work to form a family.
                                    We are a diverse gathering with a common hope - to become closer to our faith through ministry and fellowship.

                                    Lord of Life Lutheran Church is an ELCA congregation serving Farmington, Apple Valley, Lakeville, Rosemount and the 
                                    surrounding communities. Lord of Life started in the fall of 1994 to help meet the spiritual needs of people 
                                    searching for a home church, and to provide a ministry to people moving into the community. Our first service was 
                                    held in April 1995 and in April 1997, Lord of Life became an organized church of The Evangelical Lutheran Church 
                                    in America.
