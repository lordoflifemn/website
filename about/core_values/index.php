										Serving
									</h6>
                                    <p>
                                        Lord of Life faithfully invites all members to participate in meaningful actions
                                        of serving God to develop a membership of community for families and future 
                                        generations. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve...” (Mark 10:45) 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Serving defines the essence of Lord of Life. Serving is embedded in each and 
                                        every one of the core values previously discussed. Serving is the very reason 
                                        Lord of Life exists. To serve our existing members and the members we have yet
                                        to meet. Serving also comes in the way of reaching out to our community, breaking 
                                        our borders of the walls of the church, extending ourselves and our services to 
                                        others who may not be as fortunate or have a church home.

										Prayer
									</h6>
									<p>
										Lord of Life teaches the power of prayer and encourages our people to pray daily 
                                        whether it be privately, with family and friends, in worship or in fellowship with 
                                        others.

                                        Phillipians 4:6 (NIV) Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by 
                                        prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Rick Warren asks: “Do you really believe this verse?  God says you can pray about 
                                        everything. Nothing is too great for God's power.  Nothing is too insignificant for 
                                        His care.  Anything worth worrying about is worth praying about.  If we prayed as 
                                        much as we worried, we'd have a lot less to worry about!  Give God your worries. 
                                        You worship God through prayer when you give him your love (praise), your life 
                                        (purpose), and your worries (provision). What do you need today? Energy to make it 
                                        through the day? Finances?  Wisdom?  You've got two alternatives:  panic or pray.”

									    Hospitality and Creating Community
								    </h6>

									    Lord of Life is an accessible, welcoming community that gives strength to one another 
                                        and receives people as they are.

									    Worship
								    </h6>
								    <p>
									    Lord of Life’s worship service will combine uplifting music and meaningful messages 
                                        to help the members connect their daily lives to God.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Psalms 59:16 But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast 
                                        love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of 
                                        my distress.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Revelation 5:9 And they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are you to take the scroll 
                                        and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people 
                                        for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.” 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the greatest ways to worship the Lord is with song. We can find many songs 
                                        to the Lord in the Bible that serve as guidelines, reasons and examples of worship. 
                                        We can also find those songs that remind us of a loved one lost, songs that speak 
                                        to us during the rough times and songs that uplift and celebrate our successes, 
                                        milestones and seasons of the year. As we praise and worship we must always 
                                        remember the one true God who is at the heart of our worship and even when there 
                                        is no music, we should always praise and worship Him.
