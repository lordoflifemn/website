                            Our services include components of traditional Lutheran worship and blend the sounds of 
                            today's  Christian music with the passion of traditional favorites. Our goal is to hear the 
                            voice of tradition shared    as it guides new voices and expression of our time.

                            Each Sunday during September - May we have a staffed nursery, a special children's message and 
                            Sunday School is offered. A time for friendship and  refreshment is held after the service. We 
                            are committed to hearing and sharing God's promise as God speaks to us, guides  us, and 
                            inspires us to answer our call of discipleship and mission to make God first in our lives.

                        <p>
                            We share an open communion at Lord of Life; all who believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and
                            Savior are welcome to God's table of grace. A blessing is offered for children who do not yet 
                            receive communion. We celebrate communion by using intinction: we dip the bread into the wine 
                            (first cup) or the alcohol-free grape juice (second cup). <b>All are welcome!</b>
