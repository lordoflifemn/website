	What do people say about our church? 
</h6>
<p>
	Most people find Lord of Life to be a friendly and welcoming, come as you are, accepted for who you are, give of your 
    talents and leadership, grow together in spirit and faith, give as God leads you, lean on each other place, where 
    traditions are alive, music rings out, and the hope and promise and grace of Jesus Christ are made known and celebrated!
    You will find additional information in our Visitor Guide.

    Our church is not a building; it is group of regular people that have come together. United we work to form a family.
    We are a diverse gathering with a common hope - to become closer to our faith through ministry and fellowship.
